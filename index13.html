  <div class="message warning">
    In Chinese folk mythology there are two states of human being. First there is Yinjian, the world of the dead. Second, there is Yangjian, the world of the living. This is not only a physical state, but they are also seen as a possession of a parallel existence. You live in Yangjian and after you die you move to Yinjian. It is also possible to be in a Yinjian state during your life. Your subconscious Yangjian exists as a human consciousness in the form of knowledge or as a myth.
If you look back at ancient times, Yinjian often appears in visual form.
Bao gong [Bao Zeng, link] , for example, wrote with both hands simultaneously when he wrote a verdict. What he wrote with his left hand was in mirror image of what he wrote with his right hand. The script in mirror image was intended for those in the Yinjian state.
This also happened in ancient Chinese mausoleums. Texts in mirror image were meant for the dead as soon as they entered the Yinjian state.
 <br><br>
For me, writing in mirror image is not an unknown phenomenon. I started doing this because I did not want others to be able to read certain writings. Soon I noticed that what I wrote in mirror writing with my left hand was more personal. I did this unconsciously. Words flowed automatically and I did not care about my writing style. Looking back at the writing, holding my sheet of paper against the light, I became aware of what I had actually written. The space of Yinjian thus became the non-physical space, one that is subconscious and apparently one of truths. A filter, my own filter disappears during writing. I guess you could compare this with writing on a computer and being able to press CMD + Z. You will always unconsciously know that you have this option. If you write on a typewriter there is no way back so you might as well just keep going, there is no erasing of truths, or mistakes if you will.
