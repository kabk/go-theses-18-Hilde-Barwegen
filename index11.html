    This research is started because I am interested in death. Since the existence of human beings, death is the only thing we sure have to deal with after being born.
    Despite this, people still struggle to come to terms with death and how to deal with it. What happens after dying is not very explainable so it leaves a lot for the imagination.
      <br> <br>
    I could take a very scientific approach. I know you can pass away, people around you do. I could find out how exactly body parts start to fail. Or what happens when you die in a car crash. But this is not what interests me most. What really drives me is how people deal with grief visually. Which visible forms do we create to our grief substance?
      <br> <br>
    My research is presented in the form of a collection of physical expressions. How is grief visible in the things that people make?
    How do people, other than the artist or designer, make death visual in their lives?
      <br> <br>
    I feel that there is no beginning or end. No guidelines that apply to everyone. No right or wrong. There is no bad way to grieve, and that certainly means there is no necessarily good way to deal with grief. There is different ways.
    This gave a lot of space. Space to be open for different sides. While researching I shifted my approach from a normative one to a descriptive one. Rather than questioning or posing statements I want to show how different people deal with grief. This is the reason why I am making an inventory, a collection.
    This non-linear inventory is organized in alphabetical order. It gives you the option to follow your own order in reading. By following the portals I give a hint of my connections between topics.
