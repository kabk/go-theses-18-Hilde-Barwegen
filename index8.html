    First of all, it is arguable if this list is complete. I do not think it is complete, nor it will ever be. I filled it with the topics that had the most of my interest at that point.
<br><br>
Before starting, I knew that the topic of dead is one of the biggest ones out there. In art but certainly in life. I have felt completely lost in all the sub topics I had found.
This started to unthread at the moment I dove into a small starting point. At the moment my curiosity took over, when I did not try to solve or look for the truth.
<br><br>
I really had my opinions at first. I was convinced that we, here in The Netherlands, did not have a right way to grieve. That there is no space for individuals. That we have to follow guidelines already set by someone else. Institutional ways, designed by companies or churches. Books with steps to follow. You decide what flowers, coffin and cards you want. But all chosen from a book, made by someone else. A person that tells you what emotions to have. What behaviour is expected. I learned that this seems the case, but is actually untrue. Nobody tells you what to do, people just try to help each other in the way they learned how to cope with things.
<br><br>
For future learning I think it is important to dive into different participatory cultures more. This in relation to small groups and their personal expressions towards their way of dealing with grief.
This I look at within the miniature building club. But, my result is narrow as it comes to dealing with grief for them as a group.
<br><br>
This might has to do with the reason that people have no words or they simply do not want to talk. They make death a part of life visually. Sometimes this made it hard for me to write as well. It is more interesting to sometimes tease out some of the different interpretations images invoke. They are open for debate; the verbal is not yet connected to them when the viewer sees them for the first time.

Nunc est hihendum<br>
Nunc pede lihero<br>
Pulsanda tellus.
