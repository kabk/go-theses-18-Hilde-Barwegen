    Imagine seeing the museum as a graveyard. The museum as an end station. When being included in a museum, art is not alive anymore after. Art arrived at its last stadium. Cannot be changed. It ran through all phases and is ready to be taken into the archives. Only new art then, is alive.
    Artists know that their work can be collected. That it could go into archives and into art history. Unconsciously they will adapt work towards this. Because of this new art or progressive art will less likely arise. Artists will adapt so new history cannot be made. It is more of a repetition, an alteration of history that already exists.
    Therefore, art in a museum belongs directly to the past. Consider it dead. However, directly copying artworks of an already existing collection does not pave the way for entering into a collection of a museum. Work will be seen as kitsch, a copy of the already existing. You will have to make new art to become part of a collection. In a way that it meets the expectations. You thus dig the grave of your work by knowing its end station: that it will become part of a collection.
    Itâ€™s doomed to be dead, before even being alive. It is already collected before being made.
    Like Malevich wrote in 1919 in On the museum: 'life knows what it is doing, and if it is striving to destroy one must not interfere, since by hindering we are blocking the path to a new conception of life that is born within us'.
