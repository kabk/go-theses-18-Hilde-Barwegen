  <div class="message warning">
    The movie Loving Vincent shows multiple possible truths about the way Van Gogh died. A man is softly forced by his dad to deliver a letter. A letter to the relatives of Vincent van Gogh. At first instance he does not feel like doing that because he has no affinity with the deceased one [Vincent van Gogh]. After all, he is dead. However, he starts his trip to deliver the letter. He is getting involved and finds out more and more about Vincentâ€™s life. He talks to his family and people that knew him well. He even sleeps in the room where Vincent passed away. He plays an increasingly bigger role in the life of Vincent, even though he is dead already. He gets to know Vincent by stories of people and is replaying exact scenes of Vincent van Gogh his life himself. Eventually he knows how Vincent would have died and who was the culprit. He appropriated him posthumous. This is something I also notice in the theatre play Majakovski / Oktober by De Warme Winkel. (online link naar M)
     <br><br>
    The appropriation interests me. It interests me because in some cases people pretend a body still has a psyche. Or it in the case of Majakovski, his body is glorified.
