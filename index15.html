  <div class="message warning">
    Vladimir Majakovski is seen as a revolutionary man. His ideas about life where new. His work on the other hand contrasted with how he lived. Uncultivated, a lot of women and sex. Alcohol was plentiful. All of these was available in large quantities in his time and circles. His dead was suicide. Is this a lust for more attention? Was it provocation?
    In the play Majakovski / Oktober by De Warme Winkel the deathbed of Majakovski is the scene of the whole performance. The friends and lovers of Majakovski carry his body while mourning and play with it as if he were still alive. In a sense they deny the fact that he died and celebrate life. The ritual of dying to a state of decomposition can be compared to his lifestyle. Sex with his body is not despised. It almost seems like an honour to play with his dead body.
    Looking back at his life is happening during the whole piece. In every sentence you get the feeling that he has not received enough recognition. The way his companions deal with this is drinking a lot and laughing it away. The men and women are naked. Not in an overtly sexual way, but neither is the possibility of sex denied – it is rather left open.
    Following one after the other all actors, except for Majakovski’s lifeless body, leave the stage. They say their last words. They cite poems, but mostly they grab whatever they can get. Everything done with honour for the deceased one is done without paying respect. It seems that they wanted a piece of him, for themselves. As if any of his, call it grandeur, could be transferred to them. As soon as they had enough, the moment his body became cold, they disappeared.
    He ends on a stack of planks, between the imaginary four shelves, alone.
