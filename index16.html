  <div class="message warning">
    I’m in the gym. I step onto a treadmill. I look at that object dangling at a red thread attached to the machine.
    People surround me. Several are sweaty, their faces red. Some walk on a machine, slowly, gazing out.
    Staff members walk around with a firm tread. They get approached and talk for a while. They seem to do important things.
<br><br>
    I’m hesitating. I start the treadmill and walk slowly. I speed up my walking to a point I am on the verge of running. The red object follows my speed and starts to sway. My heartbeat follows the same pace. I am thinking of the moment I can stop. When I hit the ground again with my feet. The floor will have replaced the feeling of the treadmill. I will have to search for my balance for an instance.
    My mind wanders of to the red object again. It is an emergency brake. I don’t dare to attach it to my clothes. What if I accidently pull the chord and an alarm goes off? The scene of me falling onto the floor plays in front of me. I prefer not to attach it to avoid embarrassment by misuse. I prefer this to the safety the dead man’s switch is meant for.
<br><br>
    I wonder if the switch really makes a difference if I would drop dead on the treadmill. I will fall of and end on the floor, with my head still on the machine. For me it would probably not make a difference. Maybe it does for the staff. They would have to bend over my body. They would have to press the stop button of the machine to prevent my head from swaying.
    <br><br>I’ll attach the object to my clothes next time. If only it were to prevent the tough gym guys from having vivid nightmares. Nightmares of my swaying dead head on the treadmill.
